This is my homemade WebGL 3D engine with vanilla JavaScript. 

Demo site: https://neal5580.github.io/awesome-3d-viewer/

It requires using a basic HTTP web server (a NodeJS Express server) since it loads resources via Fetch API (AJAX).

Here are tips on how to play it:
- Key "1 - 5" to change models
- Key "Z" to switch camera mode (orthographic / perspective)
- Key "X" to switch mode (line / triangle)
- Mouse wheel to zoom in / out
- Mouse right button + drag to change camera's lookAt point
- Mouse left click to stop model rotation
